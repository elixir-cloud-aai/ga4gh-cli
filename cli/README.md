# GA4GH-CLI

The `ga4gh-cli` is a command line tool that leverages `ga4gh-sdk` library to provide user-frienly interface to work with the GA4GH API services. Currently, it supports GA4GH ServiceInfo and TES APIs with HTTP Basic Authorization or Token-Based Authorization.

## Configuration

The `ga4gh-cli` expects configuration in `~/.ga4gh/config.json` file. 

### Configuration Example

```json
{
    "TES": {
        "base_path": "http://localhost:8000",
        "basic_auth": {
            "username": "your_username",
            "password": "your_password"
        },
        "oauth_access_token": "your_oauth_access_token"
    }
}
```

## Usage 

### Basic local setup

In order to quickly setup a TES server locally, you can use Funnel. Dockerized Funnel version doesn't have ServiceInfo end-point on the expected path, which is requirement by the GA4GH-SDK.

1. Deploy Funnel locally following the [offical documentation](https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/download/).

2. Run Funnel server with the port specifed:

```sh
funnel server start --Server.HTTPPort=[available-port]
```

3. Configure the CLI in `~/.ga4gh-cli/config.json` using example above. Only the `base_path` needed.

### CLI Examples

1. To create a new task run the `tes create` command. You can provide task definition json data as text:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes create '{
    "name": "Hello world",
    "inputs": [{
        "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
        "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
    }],
    "outputs": [{
        "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/output.txt",
        "path": "/outputs/stdout"
    }],
    "executors": [{
        "image": "alpine",
        "command": ["cat", "/inputs/hello.txt"],
        "stdout": "/outputs/stdout"
    }]
}'
```

Or as a file:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes create ./tests/sample.tes
```

2. To retrieve the list of tasks run `tes list` command:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes list
```

Example output:

```sh
TASK ID                   State          
csei52hrqek3h222k9f0      Complete   
csei52hrqek3h222k9eg      Initializing   
csei52hrqek3h222k9e0      Canceled       
csei52hrqek3h222k9dg      Running 
csei52hrqek3h222k9df      Queued 
csei52hrqek3h222k9de      Queued 
```

3. To get the infromation about the task run the `tes get` command:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes get [TASK-ID] [VIEW]
```

Possible `VIEW` option values: `BASIC`, `FULL`.

4. To retrieve the task status run the `tes status` command:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes status [TASK-ID]      
```

5. To cancel the task run the `tes cancel` command:

```sh
ga4gh-cli tes cancel [TASK-ID]      
```
